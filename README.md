# COVID-Home-Management
---
We have seen the medical infrastructure crumble in the past few months due to covid-19 and this being the reason, there has been the unavailability of medical facilities for many patients in urgent need of guidance of a doctor and a lack of technical supports for doctors to connect with their patients. Keeping this problem in mind, we came up with our WebApp - "Medister" to provide a solution.

Medister is an App that works as a bridge between doctors and patients. This App will connect doctors with their patients and provide constant updates and daily reports of them. Considering the current scenario, if a patient is suffering from covid-19 and has consulted a doctor through our app, they can connect on a platform where the patient can keep updating their oxygen level, temperature etc. in the app. Later on, the doctors can follow up with them on daily basis and can generate daily reports.
